This repository contains the source code for my personal website that I have created to showcase my software development portfolio. **This project is _not_ open source but has instead been posted publicly so that I can showcase my software development projects.**

The website is coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to containing a sampling of multiple projects I have completed (all of which I have been given permission to post publicly when necessary), it has general information about me, contact information, and an accessibility policy. 

The live website can be accessed at [https://alexdensmore.dev](https://alexdensmore.dev).

## Reflections on What I Have Learned Creating This Website

Creating my software development portfolio has itself been an opportunity to learn new software development skills, techniques, and best practices, such as the following:
- Previously, I had hosted all websites I had created on Oregon State University's server because I had created all these websites as part of course projects. Making this website allowed me to learn how to purchase a domain name and an online web hosting account and link the domain to the server's IP address. I purchased a shared hosting package through [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/). Since I wanted a .dev domain name to signify that my website is software development focused and HostGator does not offer .dev domain names, I purchased one through [Google Domains](https://domains.google/). Consequently, I learned how to link a domain name purchased through one service to a server hosted through another service.
- Previously, all websites I hosted on Oregon State's servers used simple HTTP. I followed all of HostGator's configuration instructions so that my site could be served over HTTPS and utilize an SSL certificate (HTTPS is required for .dev domains).
- Since I noticed that many modern websites do not have .html extensions at the end of URLs (which I know is in part because some websites generate HTML content through a framework like React.js), I wanted to see if this was possible when serving traditional HTML files. After some research, I learned how to drop the .html extension from the end of URLs through settings in the [.htaccess](.htaccess) file.
- Since my shared hosting plan involves simply placing any HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files into a public_html directory that is then served automatically through Apache, but I knew that my pages would use repeated elements (such as the banner and navigation menu common to all pages), I learned how to use [SSI](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/ssi.html#configuring) (Server-Side Includes) to create templated HTML content, store it in the public_html folder, and then import that content through SSI statements. This allowed me to simply edit the templated content in one place rather than in each individual file in which it is included. I also used SSI variables (such as for identifying which item in the navigation menu should be marked as "current page" for a given HTML page). Configuring the server to use this required editing the .htaccess file within the public_html directory to enable SSI. Furthermore, so that all of my files could still use the simple .html extension (rather than .shtml), I turned on XBitHack in .htaccess and made all HTML files executable by setting the appropriate permissions bit.
- I wanted to be able to embed PDF documentation files into HTML pages so that users could view documentation for a project within that project's page (in addition to having the option to view the documentation in a new tab or download it). I researched how to use the `<iframe>` HTML tag to embed an object. Furthermore, since simply entering a PDF's name as the `src` attribute of the iframe resulted in it not displaying correctly in iOS Safari, I searched for solutions and learned how to use [Google Drive's Embedded File Viewer](https://gist.github.com/tzmartin/1cf85dc3d975f94cfddc04bc0dd399be#embedded-file-viewer) so that embedded PDFs also display nicely on iOS.
- When researching [accessibility features in React.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html) while [contributing accessibility fixes to a public GitHub repo for the game Codenames](https://alexdensmore.dev/projects/codenames) in Summer 2020, I learned how to use [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) to make elements accessible to screen reader users. However, the documentation also noted that semantic HTML5 elements can be used to help screen readers interpret HTML. Given that the project on which I was working in Summer 2020 used many `<div>` elements, I decided to simply use WAI-ARIA at the time rather than trying to restructure the HTML elements within the React.js code entirely. However, I wanted the opportunity to practice using HTML5 semantic elements. Therefore, when creating this portfolio website, I researched [HTML5 semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) and intentionally used tags such as `<main>` and `<nav>` to aid screen readers in interpreting the purpose of sections.
- When creating nav menus in my portfolio, I wanted to ensure that they would be screen reader accessible. Therefore, I researched [best practices for making nav menus and submenus accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/) (including labeling with the "arialabeledby" attribute and indicating the currently selected item).
- Having seen menus in websites where the item over which a user's mouse cursor is hovering turns a different color, I wanted to know how to accomplish this with CSS. Therefore, I learned how to use the [CSS :hover selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp).
