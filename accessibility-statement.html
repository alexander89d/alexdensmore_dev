            <p>
                When producing and updating this website, my goal is to make it accessible to all. 
                Having a visual impairment myself, accessibility is very important to me. 
                I have been teaching myself various aspects of digital accessibility while creating 
                this website. For example, I have taught myself about 
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="_blank">
                    HTML5 semantic tags
                </a> 
                for making the purpose of various sections clearer to screen reader users, 
                making use of such tags as <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>.
                In addition, I have researched best practices such as 
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/" target="_blank">
                    making menus accessible
                </a>
                . Since I am using this website in part to teach myself how to make websites accessible, 
                please feel free to <a href="contact">contact me</a> with any feedback regarding 
                any website components that are not currently accessible to you.
