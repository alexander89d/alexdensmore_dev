            <h1>Roller Coaster Database</h1>
            <p>
                This project implements a relational database, server, and frontend website. Through 
                the frontend website, users could perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) 
                operations for various amusement park-related entities: roller coasters, amusement parks, 
                roller coaster features, manufacturers, and park owners. The site was hosted on 
                the Oregon State University servers, and our database accounts were deleted once the 
                course was complete, so the website is no longer live.

            <h2>Documentation</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to submitting code for the frontend, server, and database, 
                we were required to provide documentation with our submission. 
                <strong>
                    I have slightly revised the order of sections and added / clarified headings 
                    in the documentation to make the purpose of different sections clearer to 
                    outside readers who did not complete this course. In addition, 
                    I have removed last names of those who provided peer reviews of our work. 
                    The actual content of each section is the original documentaiton content 
                    submitted with this project.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The documentation is divided into the following sections:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Project Outline: This section includes a project overview, entity definitions, 
                    and entity attributes
                </li>
                <li>
                    ERD and Schema Diagrams
                </li>
                <li>
                    Changes Based on Feedback: This section includes text of all feedback from peers 
                    and graders that we received on all previous project parts (Parts 1-6), 
                    indication of what changes we chose to make based on feedback 
                    (and reasoning why certain suggestions were not implemented), and descriptions 
                    of any additional changes we decided to make ourselves
                </li>
            </ol>
