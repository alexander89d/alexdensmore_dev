            <h1>Projects Overview</h1>
            <p>
                The various projects posted on this site are posted from oldest to newest 
                (left to right in the project navigation submenu above). These are mostly projects 
                that I completed as part of my coursework for my Bachelor of Science in Computer 
                Science at Oregon State University. <strong>All of the class projects I have posted are 
                designated "portfolio projects" which students are allowed to post publicly. 
                Furthermore, all non-class projects posted on my portfolio are 
                either personal projects that I myself created or are projects already publicly 
                available on GitHub to which I contributed code.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The "Quick Facts" section on each project page gives an overview of the purpose 
                of the project, the context in which the project was completed, what language(s) 
                were used, and a link to the projectâ€™s GitHub repository. More in-depth information 
                about each project can be viewed in its README.md file in its GitHub repository 
                (which is displayed automatically below its root directory on GitHub).
