            <h1>Foster Community Connect</h1>
            <p>
                This project creates a forum for foster families to indicate needs and potential donors 
                to read about what is needed (and possibly donate those items).
                I contributed code to this preexisting Open Source project on GitHub as part of my 
                Open Source Software course. See below for more details about and links to each pull 
                request as well as documentation submitted with the course project.
            </p>

            <h2>Documentation</h2>
            <p>
                The documentation below (submitted as part of this course project) was submitted after
                Pull Request 1 mentioned above. After taking the project manager's feedback on the first
                pull request into account regarding splitting it into smaller pull requests 
                each focused on 1 feature, I submitted Pull Request 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                This documentation submitted between the 2 pull requests gives a project overview,
                a summary of what was included in the first pull request, and a reflection on
                the experience.
            </p>
