            <h1>Continuous Integration Reflection Paper</h1>
            <p>
                This is my individual reflection paper on a group project that involved the 
                Continuous Integration paradigm using 
                <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a>. 
                <strong>While we are not permitted to share the source code from this project publicly, 
                the instructor of CS 362 (Software Engineering II) has granted students explicit 
                permission to post their reflection papers publicly for use in professional 
                portfolios.</strong>
                Each student in our group of 3 was responsible for implementing 1 of 3 specified 
                functions and then writing tests for them using Python’s 
                <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html" target="_blank">unittest</a> 
                module. We were required to make the 'master' branch protected where all potential 
                merges had to be submitted as pull requests and reviewed and approved by both 
                other teammates. We were also required to have GitHub Actions check all pull 
                requests against 
                <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">flake8</a> linting 
                standards and all tests implemented up to that point. More contextual information about 
                what specific functions we were required to implement is provided below the following 
                "Quick Facts" section.

            <h2>Additional Details about Function Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                Each member of the group of 3 picked 1 of 3 functions and the related unit tests 
                to implement. These functions all implemented already existing features of Python and 
                its libraries (and could not use various built-in keywords and libraries that would 
                make their implementation trivial). 
                I was responsible for writing and testing a function that converts strings 
                into base-10 numbers. The strings can represent base-10 integers, base-10 
                floating-point numbers, or hexadecimal integers (which must be preceded by '0x'). 
                One of my teammates wrote a function that takes the number of seconds since the epoch 
                (January 1, 1970) and converts it to a date in MM-DD-YYYY format, taking leap years 
                into account. My other teammate implemented a function which takes an integer 
                and returns its hexadecimal equivalent as a string in either big or little-endian 
                format (depending on the value of the 'endian' argument passed in by the user). 
                These low-level coding exercises that did not allow the use of many built-in 
                convenience features of Python were meant to make us focus on thorough testing 
                of the functions’ various nuances.

            <h2>Reflection Paper Layout</h2>
            <p>
                In the paper below, I reflect on my experience with other team projects in my 
                Computer Science degree program and then specifically on this Continuous Integration 
                project. As per assignment instructions, 
                the paper is divided into the following three sections:
            </p>
