            <p>
                I am a recent Bachelor of Science in Computer Science graduate seeking 
                full-time employment as a software developer. I have particular interests 
                in educational technology and digital accessibility, but I would be excited 
                to contribute to any software that will help people with one or more aspects 
                of their lives.

            <p>
                I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Oregon State University 
                in December 2020. I took coursework in web development, databases, 
                mobile application development, cloud application development, open source software, 
                software engineering, operating systems, networking, 
                computer architecture and assembly language, data structures, analysis of algorithms, 
                and discrete mathematics. 
                I really enjoyed the degree program and the various problems we solved in coursework, 
                whether it was creating a 
                <a href="projects/musical-roman-quest" target="_blank">text-based board game with ASCII graphics</a>, 
                designing a 
                <a href="projects/church-accessibility" target="_blank">visually-appealing, user-friendly website</a>, 
                creating a 
                <a href="projects/smallsh" target="_blank">Linux shell</a> to better understand 
                operating systems, or writing an <a href="projects/file-transfer" target="_blank">FTP program</a> 
                to learn more about networking. 
                I have also enjoyed extending and applying my learning outside of the classroom, 
                such as by teaching myself Python in Summer 2019 since my coursework had not yet covered 
                that language and I was curious to learn it, and by 
                <a href="projects/codenames" target="_blank">contributing code to an online implementation of the game Codenames</a> 
                in Summer 2020 to make it screen-reader accessible.
