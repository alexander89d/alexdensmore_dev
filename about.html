            <img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" class="float-right" alt="">
            <p>
                I am a recent Bachelor of Science in Computer Science graduate seeking 
                full-time employment as a software developer. I have particular interests 
                in educational technology and digital accessibility, but I would be excited 
                to contribute to any software that will help people with one or more aspects 
                of their lives.
            </p>
            <h2>Computer Science Training</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Oregon State University 
                in December 2020. I took coursework in web development, databases, 
                mobile application development, cloud application development, open source software, 
                software engineering, operating systems, networking, 
                computer architecture and assembly language, data structures, analysis of algorithms, 
                and discrete mathematics. 
                I really enjoyed the degree program and the various problems we solved in coursework, 
                whether it was creating a 
                <a href="projects/musical-roman-quest" target="_blank">text-based board game with ASCII graphics</a>, 
                designing a 
                <a href="projects/church-accessibility" target="_blank">visually-appealing, user-friendly website</a>, 
                creating a 
                <a href="projects/smallsh" target="_blank">Linux shell</a> to better understand 
                operating systems, or writing an <a href="projects/file-transfer" target="_blank">FTP program</a> 
                to learn more about networking. 
                I have also enjoyed extending and applying my learning outside of the classroom, 
                such as by teaching myself Python in Summer 2019 since my coursework had not yet covered 
                that language and I was curious to learn it, and by 
                <a href="projects/codenames" target="_blank">contributing code to an online implementation of the game Codenames</a> 
                in Summer 2020 to make it screen-reader accessible.

            <h2>Transition from Education Field to Computer Science Field</h2>
            <p>
                My prior degrees are a Bachelor of Arts in Latin from Oberlin College in 2011 
                and a Master of Education in Foreign Language Education from Ohio State University 
                in 2012. I taught Latin (primarily online) for several years while also 
                tutoring K-12 students, college students, and adult learners in English Essay Writing 
                online (I continue tutoring English Essay Writing online to this day). 
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized just how passionate I am about technology during my various teaching 
                experiences. For example, one challenge online teachers often face is adapting 
                resources from face-to-face environments to online environments. I wanted to 
                ensure that my online Latin students had access to vocabulary flashcards digitally, 
                but I did not want my students to need to access a website external from the LMS 
                (learning management system) on which asynchronous class content was housed. 
                Therefore, I researched how to use a website called 
                <a href="https://www.studystack.com/" target="_blank">StudyStack.com</a> 
                to make digital flash cards and then imbed them directly into my online class pages 
                using HTML code. I was amazed that this could be done so seamlessly. 
                As another example, during my year of face-to-face teaching, I enjoyed integrating 
                technology into my teaching as appropriate, such as using an educational game called 
                <a href="https://kahoot.com/" target="_blank">Kahoot!</a> 
                where I could write multiple choice questions that I could project 
                on the board for students and then students could answer questions with their smartphones. This was not only engaging and fun for students, but it helped them review key course concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                While reflecting one day in early 2018 on just how much of a passion I have for 
                technology and meeting students’ needs through it, I recalled how much I enjoyed 
                taking an Introduction to Computer Science class during my final semester of my BA 
                in Latin (Spring 2012). I decided that, based on my interests and skillset, 
                I would like to contribute to the development of software that will help others. 
                Therefore, I enrolled in 
                <a href="https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academic/online-cs-postbacc" target="_blank">Oregon State’s Online Postbaccalaureate BS in Computer Science program</a>, 
                which is geared toward those like myself who have a degree in another field and want to transition into the Computer Science field.

            <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
            <p>
                I am a member and on the Board of Directors of the 
                <a href="https://www.acbohio.org/" target="_blank">American Council of the Blind (ACB) of Ohio</a>. I serve on the Technology, Newsletter, and Nominating Committees. 
                I am also involved at the local level as a member of the Cleveland, Ohio chapter of ACB. 
                In addition, I am involved with 
                <a href="https://acb.org/" target="_blank">ACB at the national level</a> and have attended 3 national 
                conventions. I enjoy meeting with others who are blind and visually impaired and 
                discussing advocacy and accessibility with them. I have been involved with the 
                American Council of the Blind since 2013. In fact, I met my wife while skydiving at the 
                2014 ACB national convention!
            </p>
            <p>
                I also donate blood and platelets to the American Red Cross to help patients in need. 
                In addition, my wife and I sponsor children in the Dominican Republic through 
                <a href="https://www.kidsalive.org/" target="_blank">Kids Alive International</a> 
                to help support their physical, emotional, social, educational, and spiritual needs.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Christian, and my wife and I enjoy participating in our local church 
                and being members of a small group Bible study. I also enjoy riding roller coasters 
                (I have traveled to many different amusement parks), playing games, 
                going for walks in nature, and spending time with family and friends.
